# Class-Conditional-VAE-GAN-for-Local-Ancestry-Simulation
PyTorch code used in Class-Conditional VAE-GAN for Local-Ancestry Simulation paper.

The code has been tested using out-of-africa simulations (https://github.com/slowkoni/out-of-africa-model, https://github.com/slowkoni/admixture-simulation) and 1000 genomes project data (https://www.internationalgenome.org/home).
